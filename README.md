# MiniEcom Backend Application

Welcome to the **MiniEcom Backend Application**! This project provides a scalable and efficient backend architecture for an eCommerce platform, built using a microservices approach with Spring Boot.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services for **Product**, **Order**, **Inventory**, and **Notifications**.
- **RESTful APIs**: Robust API endpoints for each service to allow easy communication and extensibility.
- **API Gateway**: Implemented with **Spring Cloud Gateway MVC** to handle routing and ensure secure communication.
- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Leveraging **Kafka** for improved performance and reliability of service interactions.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secured using **Keycloak** for managing user roles and access.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Integrated **Grafana Stack** for real-time monitoring and performance tracking.

## Architecture

This project uses a **microservices architecture** where each service operates independently, making the system scalable and easy to maintain. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main components:

1. **Product Service**: Manages product information.
2. **Order Service**: Handles customer orders.
3. **Inventory Service**: Tracks stock levels.
4. **Notifications Service**: Sends notifications on events like order status updates.
